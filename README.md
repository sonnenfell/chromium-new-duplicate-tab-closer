## Close New Duplicate Tabs (Edge/Chromium WebExtension)

This small WebExtension automatically detects and closes a tab immediately after it is created if the same URL is already open in another tab.

This functionality specifically targets links clicked to open in a new tab (e.g., Right Click -> "Open link in new tab" or Middle Mouse Button) and ignores tabs that simply navigate to a duplicate URL after they have been open for some time. It also ignores new tabs.

*This extension runs locally and does not collect or store any data. See all deatails on this in in [PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/sonnenfell/firefox-new-duplicate-tab-closer/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)*

Simply head this extensions [Edge extensions page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/close-new-duplicate-tabs/eodgaejgnllljkaeglpclgooobmelhdh) and click on "Get". The extension will then be automatically installed.
