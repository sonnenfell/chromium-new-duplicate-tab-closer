## 🦊 Close New Duplicate Tabs (Firefox WebExtension)

This small Firefox WebExtension automatically detects and closes a tab immediately after it is created if the same URL is already open in another tab.

This functionality specifically targets links clicked to open in a new tab (e.g., Ctrl+Click or Middle Mouse Button) and ignores tabs that simply navigate to a duplicate URL after they have been open for some time. It also ignores new tabs that open to the default Firefox start page (`about:newtab`).

[This extension does not collect or store any data.](https://github.com/sonnenfell/firefox-new-duplicate-tab-closer/blob/main/PRIVACY.md)
